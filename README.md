## 🧠 Thesis Overview

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Falls are a leading cause of injury among elderly individuals. Autonomous care robots equipped with real-time fall detection systems can play a vital role in ensuring timely assistance and reducing fatal consequences.

### 🛠️ Solution
This system uses a **CNN-LSTM hybrid model** along with **MediaPipe Pose Estimation** to detect falls accurately and sends emergency alerts via **WhatsApp API** in real-time.
